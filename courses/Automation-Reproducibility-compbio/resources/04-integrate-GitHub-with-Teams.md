# Integrate GitHub with Teams application ######################################

(1)	Add GitHub app on the Teams app. This shows as a separate personal chat. 

(2) Subscribe the [stjude-dnb-binfcore](https://github.com/stjude-dnb-binfcore/) account and integrate GitHub and Teams apps to get the notifications. 

(3) Every team member needs to download the app, signin and they should be able to get the notifications in their personal chat (since I added [stjude-dnb-binfcore](https://github.com/stjude-dnb-binfcore/) account). Group chat is not currently supported by Teams (unless it is under a GitHub enterprise account). 

(4) Ensure that you sign up for receiving notifications for the repositories you are interested in.

(5) Alternatively, you may use [integrate GitHub with Slack](https://slack.github.com/) app.
